  <br>

 * I have a Ph.D. in [Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html) (started with [String Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) and ended with Astrophysics) at [Stony Brook University, New York](https://www.stonybrook.edu/), received with full-tuition and research scholarship. *You can call me Dr. von Steinkirch if you would like to honor and respect those who spend years pursuing this degree.*

* My [second website during grad school](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/index.html) was the home of all my research papers, e-books, homework, etc. I used to publish a lot:
  - The first book I published was on [Group Theory](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/group.pdf), which seems to be popular among graduate students at CALTECH (at least, that's what [Prof. Maria Spiropulu](http://pma.divisions.caltech.edu/people/maria-spiropulu) told me). I also wrote a book on [Quantum Computing](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/qi.pdf) and [Quantum Field Theory](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/books/qft.pdf).
  - I published several peer-reviewed articles: [scientific articles published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2u83QMkAAAAJ&hl=en) in [Nuclear](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.86.024908), [Astrophysics](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/832/2/102), and [Cosmology](http://cds.cern.ch/record/1249755/files/p533.pdf). 
  -  I wrote [dozen of papers and open-source projects on theoretical Physics](http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/steinkirch/#notes), [Machine Learning](https://github.com/bt3gl-labs/NetAna-Complex_Network_Analysis), [Gray Hacking](https://github.com/bt3gl-labs/Pentesting-Toolkit), [GCP security](https://github.com/bt3gl-labs/Amigo-Google_Cloud_Platform_Security), and [how-to write-ups on Linux, security, and Python](https://coderwall.com/bt3gl) (when there were not many out there in 2014-ish).

* My first job as a software engineer was at the security team at [Yelp](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/), in San Francisco. I created an in-house machine learning software for DNS/Web endpoint data analysis and worked on several infrastructure and security tasks.

* I was part of two hacking CTF teams (hacking capture the flag games): [Joel Eriksson](https://twitter.com/owarida?lang=en)'s [HackingForSoju (23th in 2014)](https://hackingforsoju.team/), and [Snatch The Root (29th in 2014)](https://ctftime.org/team/7016). I also gave a talk at DEF CON once about [hacking quantum cryptography](https://github.com/bt3gl/talks_and_outreach/blob/master/2015/Hacking%20Quantum%20Cryptography.pdf) at [the cryptovillage](https://www.defcon.org/) (in their first year!).

  
* I wrote and open-sourced a book on [Python and Algorithms](https://github.com/bt3gl-labs/Book-on-Python-and-Algorithms) (with [1k+ GitHub stars](https://gist.github.com/bt3gl/c6c1847a3fc4d95621049c3b31118629)). In 2015, [Hanbit Media](https://m.hanbit.co.kr/media/books/book_view.html?p_code=B8465804191) bought my book to have it translated into Korean. 

  
* I used to have a technical blog called [singularity.sh](https://web.archive.org/web/20180626032114/http://bt3gl.github.io/), about technology, software, and security.

* I was a senior engineer at the Core OS (security) team at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/business/docs/site/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf) in Cupertino, for a year, under [Ivan Krstić](https://twitter.com/radian?lang=en)'s supervision. I developed software to help with Apple's internal security and incident response, researched iOS Security hardening, and helped write Apple's Deep Learning toolkit for richer data augmentation for image recognition.

* I was a senior engineer at [Etsy](https://codeascraft.com/), in NYC, for a year and a half, on [Will Rogers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-rogers-b662b6a9)'s and [Ben Hughes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beayeah)'s team. I developed an incident response infrastructure for Etsy's fleet, with OSQuery, and implemented fraud detection analytics.

  <br>

* I worked at [Surfline](https://surfline.com) in Huntington Beach, CA, where I built an [end-to-end pipeline & software for surfers to retrieve clips of the waves they caught](https://www.surfline.com/lp/sessions) (from over 500+ cameras worldwide). I also helped maintain a worldwide camera infrastructure. 

* I was a researcher engineer at [Quantum Gravity Research Institute](https://quantumgravityresearch.org/), working with [Klee Irwin](https://www.kleeirwin.com/) and his team in Malibu to simulate a quantum gravitational theory on quasicrystals. I taught Python, Agile, and DevOps to a team of 10+ scientists.

* I worked at [Reaction Commerce](https://reactioncommerce.com/), in Los Angeles, developing infrastructure, Kubernetes, Kustomize stuff, with [Grig Gheorghiu](https://blog.reactioncommerce.com/meet-grig-gheorghiu/).

* I worked as a quantum scientist/engineer at [Zapata Computing](http://zapatacomputing.com/), researching quantum machine learning with [Dr. Alejandro Perdomo-Ortiz's](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-perdomo) team. This was around the same time my L.A. friend [PBJ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickbjustice) and I created [Curiee](https://web.archive.org/web/20201020221520/https://curiee.com/), a non-profit language-agnostic destination for hackers to learn, play, and publish quantum computing research.

 <br>

  
* Peeps seem to care about these things: I bought my first BTC back in 2015 and received my first ETHs in 2017.  I own very little fiat (💾, 💾).  
  
 * I worked as a senior software engineer at [Nifty Gateway, Gemini](https://niftygateway.com/) for a few months. It was a fun experience, and I met cool folks like [Matt English](https://twitter.com/smatthewenglish?lang=en), [conviction](https://twitter.com/conviction_1), and the Cock Foster brothers.
  
 * I was the Head of Blockchain Engineering at [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/), at [Kaz Nejatian](https://twitter.com/CanadaKaz)'s and [Alex Danco](https://twitter.com/Alex_Danco)'s team, where I founded and bootstrapped the engineering team. I am very fond of that gang!
  
* I founded [MidsummerDAO](https://docs.midsummer.party/) with [Chad Hugghins](https://twitter.com/ChadHugghins) (Head of Marketing at Polygon), [Ian Grant](https://twitter.com/TheRealIanQ), and [Damien Solarz](https://twitter.com/damienstolarz), later pivoted to [FilmmakerDAO](http://filmmakerdao.com/). We did a lot of [cool stuff](https://story.mirror.xyz/gbwXf_IOm4BkUNmWYWz5M-47Te8ELuQngClR8iHFxDU) but dissolved the project when folks didn't have the time for the DAO anymore. Cool friends I made on the journey: [SwanVR](https://twitter.com/SwanVR), [Shan from Livepeer](https://twitter.com/shanvasion), [Jenil from Coinvise](https://twitter.com/0xjenil), [Petra Wilson](https://twitter.com/IxaBrjnko), and [Hanamichi](https://twitter.com/0xHanamichi). Ah, btw, I am developerDAO #2247.
  
* I talked at [LisCon 2021 main stage](https://vimeo.com/638007916) about the *importance of storytelling for a functional society* and a theoretical model to reward artists in the film production industry.
  
* I was part of [Launch House's](https://twitter.com/launchhouse) first and second web3 cohort in Beverly Hills and NYC. Made some good friends and lived their fun lifestyle for a little but couldn't keep up with the hype for too long. Friends I enjoyed meeting: [Cameron from Aquari](https://twitter.com/cameronclarke98), [Alex, the Crypto Cowboy](https://twitter.com/cowboyincrypto), [Filipe Macedo](https://twitter.com/filmacedo), [Eman from AncientWarNFT](https://twitter.com/EmanFT_), [Caleb Gates from Colab.land](https://twitter.com/calebcgates), [Gail from Metaphor](https://twitter.com/gaildewilson), [Shun Kakinoki](https://twitter.com/shunkakinoki), [Joey from Folio](https://twitter.com/jp), [Prad from Sonr](https://twitter.com/thisisprad), [Jordan from DiamondDAO](https://twitter.com/amphib0ly), and [Ibrahim from Dropverse](https://twitter.com/redacted_io).

* I wrote the smart contract for an on-chain generative NFT collection called **"Storytelling Cards"**: [generativestory.com](https://generativestory.com/). It consisted of a collection of 1999 randomized story cards, generated and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. It was pretty fun to develop this project, inspired by [Loot](https://etherscan.io/address/0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7#code/)'s smart contract.

* Some homies and I invest and advise early-stage decentralized web3 founders from unprivileged backgrounds at [paraboles.xyz](https://paraboles.xyz/).
  
* My friends from [Talent Protocol](https://medium.com/@talentprotocol/talent-protocol-season-1-a-story-in-numbers-4f0c2bf97c8d) believe my talent can be profitable, so [they created **$MIA** on CELO](https://beta.talentprotocol.com/talent/bt3gl?tab=overview). I am bullish on them 🖤
  
* Two of my homies, Harvard dropouts [Lucas Chi](https://twitter.com/edchucation) and [Emmet Halm](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmethalm), founded [DAOHQ](https://www.daohq.xyz/), and I helped with the engineering side of the project.
